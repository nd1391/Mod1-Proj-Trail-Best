        YOUR JOURNEY AWAITS YOU:

            What type of life will you lead?  What’s most important to you on your journey?  Will you focus on strengthening yourself, or have a little bit of fun along the way?  Fancy yourself a trader, or are you a wildling looking to steal your way to the end?  Each activity chosen at each pitstop will be reflected in its effect on your posse’s points.  Your success will be measured by how much health, spirit and money you have at your final destination.

        <h3 class="main-title">Moonshiner</h3>
        <p>A life of shine!  You’ve lived a full life of hard work already, yet eager for a journey.  Bootleggin’ ain’t what it used to be, at least not around these parts.  So you welcome the idea of finding settlement elsewhere.  Your hard life has made you and yours better suited than most for the travel, and there ain’t a group from here to Hutzaplutz that can top your hoedown!  The road awaits you like a freshly cracked bottle o’ nectar!</p>
        <h3 class="main-title">Hunter</h3>
        <p>Are you the hunter or hunted?  Killing sheep can be easy, so long as the sheep don’t fight back!  You’ve built your wealth from your expertise with animals.  But the livestock farm you helped raise is evolving with the next generation, and they’re not too fond of how well you wield a set of shears and a gun.  Legend has it that an old bear came out of hibernation and trashed a caravan selling a mysterious medical substance.  He’s been terrorizing small towns with no suitable hunters able to track him.  You’re tired of all the lame sheep jokes you get so you set out to show your mettle against this worthy foe.  You stutter in fear as you read the nickname the bear has been dubbed - C-C-Cain Bear!  </p>
        <h3 class="main-title">Outlaw</h3>
        <p> You’re young, dumb and full of… GUN!  Guns plural, to be sure, and much ammo in those guns.  The going is tough but you and your gang are tougher.  The road ahead excites you, and your success is only limited by how wild you dare to be.  Stealing is your trade, but you can handle anything!  Anything but the law, who’s rumored to be tracking down outlaws such as yourself.  If only you knew of their whereabouts…
