        YOUR JOURNEY AWAITS YOU:
        The year is 1820.  Everyone seems to be on a mission to get out of town.  You have so many fond memories, but the road is calling your name!  It shouts out at you! - - - 
        Provide a name of the one who will lead your posse  in the space below.
        Select one of the three roles that your posse will travel as.
        </p>
        <p id="instructions">
            What type of life will you lead?  What’s most important to you on your journey?  Will you focus on strengthening yourself, or have a little bit of fun along the way?  Fancy yourself a trader, or are you a wildling looking to steal your way to the end?  Each activity chosen at each pitstop will be reflected in its effect on your posse’s points.  Your success will be measured by how much health, spirit and money you have at your final destination.
