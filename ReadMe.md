1. PROJECT TITLE & SUMMARY
The project is titled The Oregon Trail, as the game within is a reduced form of the old Oregon Trail, released in 1971s.  I tried to emulate its emphasis on exploration and the unknown, while keeping its simplistic view on how difficult travel could be for various reasons.

My Oregon Trail has a similar setting to the original - a tale of western exploration in an age where nothing was certain.  Folks packed up and left towns for the hope of a new life, with or without any skills or belongings that might help them along the way.  But my game tends to highlight what I consider to be the most important skill while traveling in foreign areas - situational awareness.  Unlike its former, my Oregon Trail is riddled with hints of what is most pertinent to perform at given locations.  To quote the great George R. R. Martin, "the devil is always in the details."


2. HOW TO PLAY
A player provides their name and what type of posse they would like to travel as, deciding between a Moonshiner, Hunter or Outlaw.  Each posse has intrinsic perks and bonuses depending upon what activities you think you will be most interested in during your travels.  They also have assumed base stats, that can be inferred by what that career/life might have afforded your life.  They each have colorful background stories provided on the landing page that may also give context that you resonate with.  There's no right or wrong posse to choose, but should absolutely correlate to your interests.  The player's primary stats that are considered the goal of the game are Health, Spirit and Money.  Health directly relates to food, and how well provisioned you are to continue the journey.  Spirit is related to your self-esteem and your will to go on.  Money sort of encompasses the other two, as it is perceived to solve any problem.

Once provided, the player then goes through five different stations, all with a different setting yet with the same options of how to spend your time.  It's established that at each station you will camp - but what will you do to enhance your travel?  The player will choose one of four activities at each station - hunt, steal, party or trade - and each will provide certain benefits to the posse.  And if you're paying attention, the setting description lends hand to unique occurrences that serve as bonuses if the correlating activity to that station is chosen.  Some dos and don'ts are provided via context clues.  Choose wisely.

If the player makes it to Oregon, the stats are prioritized and tallied to provide a score.  Think you can beat that high score?  While the data and code absolutely suggests there is a pattern to how you should travel, there is a touch of randomness of what decisions will yeild the highest score.


3. MOTIVATION
It's easily forgotten that not too long ago, video games were just this.  Number input represented the only interaction you could have with the game.  And I recall sitting in computer class LOVING this game.  Jimmy got cholera?!  Gary is dysentary?!  No clue what any of that is but let me etch a funny quote on his gravestone.  It was a simple form of interactive storytelling that I feel still has value today, and so I wanted to highlight a game such as that with my beginner's knowledge of web development.

Not to mention that, historically speaking, these adventures were insane.  While revisiting history, it always blows my mind that people found comfort in sailing or wagoning for months or years at a time.  Just volunteering to put their life into a void of unkown on a whimsicle hope that their life would improve at the end.  It's something we can't dare to comprehend today, and should be inspiring to think that our anscestors did this regularly.  The unknown is scary, but sometimes worth taking.  Oh there's gold 2,200 miles away?  Fetch me my best horse, I'll see you in 30 years, baby.


4. CODING STYLE/LANGUAGES USED
Coding was limited to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a heavy emphasis on DOM manipulation.


5. CREDITS
Oddly enough my biggest credit goes to the VisitOregon.com website, whos primary interest is to lure would-be travelers to Oregon.  Of course it's really just a basic tourist website to showcase Oregon as a suitable vacation spot, but it is wildly ironic under my context.  They even have the game playable on the site, with a full history and walk through of the game!  So while I post the link below, I would also like to advocate for the website's interest - Oregon is surely a beautiful place to visit and you should give their site some traffic at the very least.

Going to credit the various mediums by which I quoted or subtly referenced.  They will not be named but if it looks familiar, it is.

Joshua Miller & Christina Takara should be credited with instilling any ounce of coding wisdom I currently possess.  Also, if Joshua had not made JS Classes of hobbits, I may not have ever envisioned creating an interactive story like this.
